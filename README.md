# GitHub Merge Guardian

GitHub Merge Guardian is a browser extension that helps to prevent incorrect merges on GitHub Pull Request pages by changing the merge button color.

## Features

- Configure multiple rules based on owner, repository name, base branch, compare branch, and merge strategy.
- Use * as a wildcard in each item.
- Change the merge button color to draw attention when the merge strategy doesn't match the configured rules.
- Merge button color change only indicates the suggestion; you can still perform other merge strategies if needed.
- To prevent accidental merging, the merge button is disabled when the merge strategy doesn't match the configured rules.
- Customize the merge button color.
